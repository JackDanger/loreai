/**
 * Build @loreai/core into publishable ESM bundles.
 *
 * Two targets:
 * - dist/node/index.js — uses node:sqlite (for Pi extension, ACP server, etc.)
 * - dist/bun/index.js  — uses bun:sqlite  (for OpenCode plugin)
 *
 * esbuild resolves the `#db/driver` subpath import map per target via
 * `conditions: ["node"]` or `conditions: ["bun"]`.
 *
 * TypeScript declarations (.d.ts) are emitted separately by `tsc` below.
 * esbuild alone can't produce declarations.
 *
 * Runs under either Bun (during `bun run build`) or Node; the build itself is
 * runtime-agnostic (esbuild is a plain npm package).

// We intentionally DO bundle `remark`, `mdast-*`, `uuidv7`, `zod`, and other
// pure-JS dependencies so consumers get a single-file bundle and can't break
// us by upgrading transitive deps. This matches what most published libraries
// do and keeps the install footprint small.
// Runtime built-ins. `platform: "node"` auto-externalizes `fs`, `path`, etc.
// We list `node:*` and `bun:*` explicitly so any `node:` or `bun:` prefixed
// import is preserved as-is in the output (important for bun:sqlite).
// fastembed + its native transitive deps (onnxruntime-node, @anush008/tokenizers)
// must stay external — they contain platform-specific native binaries that
