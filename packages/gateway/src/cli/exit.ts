/**
 * Safe process exit for the Bun standalone binary.
 *
 * Bun 1.3.x panics with "A C++ exception occurred" when NAPI modules (e.g.
 * onnxruntime-node loaded by @huggingface/transformers) are cleaned up during
 * normal process.exit() teardown. This module provides `safeExit()` which uses
 * libc `_exit()` via FFI to skip atexit handlers and NAPI teardown.
 *
 * Falls back to `process.exit()` when:
 *  - Not running under Bun (Node.js handles NAPI teardown correctly)
 *  - `bun:ffi` is unavailable
 *  - All FFI dlopen attempts fail
 *
 * `_exit()` skips: atexit handlers, stdio flushing, NAPI destructor hooks.
 * This is safe for the gateway because:
 *  - SQLite WAL mode handles incomplete writes (journal recovery)
 *  - The embedding worker is unref'd and exits on its own
 *  - stderr output was already flushed before shutdown() completed
 */
