/**
 * Global concurrency limiter for background LLM work.
 *
 * Wraps fire-and-forget background LLM calls (idle distillation,
 * curation, pipeline-triggered incremental distillation) through a
 * single p-limit(2) so at most 2 background LLM operations run
 * concurrently across all sessions.
 *
 * Note: auto-import extraction (`import-auto.ts`) is NOT wrapped here —
 * it creates its own LLM client and runs sequentially per-process.
 * The circuit breaker still provides protection for import because
 * `tripCircuitBreaker` is called from `llm-adapter.ts` on any 429
 * (urgent included — an urgent call keeps retrying but still pauses
 * other background work), and import uses the same adapter.
 *
 * Also provides a circuit breaker that trips on upstream 429 responses,
 * pausing all background work for the Retry-After period. This prevents
 * cascading retries from consuming the rate limit budget that
 * conversation turns need.
