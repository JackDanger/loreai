/**
 * Build @loreai/pi into a publishable ESM bundle for Node.
 *
 * Pi runs on Node exclusively (unlike OpenCode which is Bun), so we only
 * build one target with `node:sqlite` imports preserved via `conditions: ["node"]`.
 *
 * External — all of these are resolved at consumer install time, NOT bundled:
 *
 * - `@loreai/gateway` — started in-process via dynamic import; published
 *   separately so users benefit from gateway updates without a pi republish.
 * - `@earendil-works/*` — Pi bundles these internally and injects them via
 *   jiti's virtualModules when loading extensions. Bundling our own copies
 *   would break: jiti resolves imports to the virtual modules, but if we
 *   inline a copy in our bundle, code that depends on module identity
 *   (extension type checks, event bus registrations) sees two different
 *   instances and silently fails to register.
