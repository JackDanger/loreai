/**
 * Build @loreai/pi into a publishable ESM bundle for Node.
 *
 * Pi runs on Node exclusively (unlike OpenCode which is Bun), so we only
 * build one target with `node:sqlite` imports preserved via `conditions: ["node"]`.
 *
 * External — all of these are resolved at consumer install time, NOT bundled:
 *
 * - `@loreai/core` — published separately; users picking up a new core
 *   version (security/bug fix) automatically benefit without a pi republish.
 * - `@mariozechner/*` — Pi bundles these internally and injects them via
 *   jiti's virtualModules when loading extensions. Bundling our own copies
 *   would break: jiti resolves imports to the virtual modules, but if we
 *   inline a copy in our bundle, code that depends on module identity
 *   (extension type checks, event bus registrations) sees two different
 *   instances and silently fails to register.
 * - `typebox` — Pi bundles this via the same virtualModules mechanism.
 *   Pi's docs explicitly require pi-package authors to mark it as a
 *   peerDependency. We inlined it previously, which is why our v0.10.1
 *   extension silently didn't register in real Pi installs.
